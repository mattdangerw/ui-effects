def set_offscreen_redirect(redirect)
</code></synopsis>
<p>Defines the circumstances where the actor should be redirected into
an offscreen image. The offscreen image is used to flatten the
actor into a single image while painting for two main reasons.
Firstly, when the actor is painted a second time without any of its
contents changing it can simply repaint the cached image without
descending further down the actor hierarchy. Secondly, it will make
the opacity look correct even if there are overlapping primitives
in the actor.</p><p>Caching the actor could in some cases be a performance win and in
some cases be a performance lose so it is important to determine
which value is right for an actor before modifying this value. For
example, there is never any reason to flatten an actor that is just
a single texture (such as a <link xref="Clutter.Texture">Clutter.Texture</link>) because it is
effectively already cached in an image so the offscreen would be
redundant. Also if the actor contains primitives that are far apart
with a large transparent area in the middle (such as a large
CluterGroup with a small actor in the top left and a small actor in
the bottom right) then the cached image will contain the entire
image of the large area and the paint will waste time blending all
of the transparent pixels in the middle.</p><p>The default method of implementing opacity on a container simply
forwards on the opacity to all of the children. If the children are
overlapping then it will appear as if they are two separate glassy
objects and there will be a break in the color where they
overlap. By redirecting to an offscreen buffer it will be as if the
two opaque objects are combined into one and then made transparent
which is usually what is expected.</p><p>The image below demonstrates the difference between redirecting and
not. The image shows two Clutter groups, each containing a red and
a green rectangle which overlap. The opacity on the group is set to
128 (which is 50%). When the offscreen redirect is not used, the
red rectangle can be seen through the blue rectangle as if the two
rectangles were separately transparent. When the redirect is used
the group as a whole is transparent instead so the red rectangle is
not visible where they overlap.</p><p>&lt;figure id="offscreen-redirect"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Sample of using an offscreen redirect for transparency&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;graphic fileref="offscreen-redirect.png" format="PNG"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p>The default value for this property is 0, so we effectively will
never redirect an actor offscreen by default. This means that there
are times that transparent actors may look glassy as described
above. The reason this is the default is because there is a
performance trade off between quality and performance here. In many
cases the default form of glassy opacity looks good enough, but if
it's not you will need to set the
%CLUTTER_OFFSCREEN_REDIRECT_AUTOMATIC_FOR_OPACITY flag to enable
redirection for opacity.</p><p>Custom actors that don't contain any overlapping primitives are
recommended to override the has_overlaps() virtual to return False
for maximum efficiency.</p>
